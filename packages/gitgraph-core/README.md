file.

Run unit tests with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) as a guideline for our versioning here.

### What does that mean?

```

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the `<major>` (and resets the `<minor>`
  and `<patch>`)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bump the `<minor>` (and
  reset the `<patch>`)
* Bug fixes and misc. changes bump the `<patch>`
